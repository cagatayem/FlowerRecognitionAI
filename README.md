# FlowerRecognition

Web Application which classifies 5 different type of flowers using Flask Python designed by me.

You can visit the website http://cagatayem.com/flower/ in order to see the design of it.

Write npm install after you dowloaded in order to download dependencies(sass).

For back-end you need to create a virtual environment.
